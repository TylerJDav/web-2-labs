# React Router

This template is the result of following along with the [React Router Tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial)

To run, ensure the terminal pwd is react-router-project, then use command `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`
The terminal will reload, showing the port where we can navigate to to find the app running.
